# CodeGig

## What is this?
A project that allows you to add developer contract roles (gigs) and then view and search for them according to your preferences.  Eg. length of contract, budget, tech stack etc.

## How to Run:

Clone repo and start server
``` $ nodemon ```
To see displayed data on PSQL, create a DB on the console or download PgAdmin to have a clearer UI and create a DB here.

## Tech Used:

- PostgreSQL Database and PgAdmin Tool  
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- HTML + CSS with Handlebars

## How would I Improve this project
- I would pull in real data for contracting roles from an API that would display the current roles available and remove any roles which had been filled.
- I would include a field for location and make sure people could search for gigs by location and particular distances from where they are based.
